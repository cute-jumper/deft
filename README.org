* Deft
Yet another fork of git://jblevins.org/git/deft.git. Make slight
modification myself in order to meet my own needs, though. :)

** How to use
See http://jblevins.org/projects/deft/ .

** What I modified
Deft *only* search files ended with the extension in the
`deft-directory', not recursively. It might work very well in the
author's situation. However, my knowledge base is organized by both
the structure of directories and files. Therefore, what I did was to
modify the function that list all files in the deft buffer to make it
search the directory recursively. To be specific, its name is
`deft-find-all-file'. 

That's all. Hmm, Quite small modification~
